#### Title
DVD Logo Bouncing Animation

#### Error Explanation
The compilation error in the project is due to an unresolved import: `mint::Point2` in `src/game.rs`. The error occurs because the `mint` crate is not directly included in the project's dependencies. Instead, `ggez` provides a re-exported `mint` module that should be used.

#### Current Solution Approach
The approach involves using `mint::Point2` directly, which is incorrect without the `mint` crate as a dependency.

#### New Solution Approach

1. **Correct Import Usage:**
   - Update the import statement to use `ggez::mint::Point2`, which is the correct path provided by the `ggez` library.

2. **Verify Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies, such as `ggez` and `rand`, are correctly listed in `Cargo.toml`.

3. **Testing:**
   - After making corrections, test the build process to ensure that the error is resolved and the application functions as expected.

#### Design Considerations

1. **Graphics Library:**
   - Continue using the `ggez` library for rendering, ensuring all its modules are correctly utilized.

2. **Code Maintenance:**
   - Regularly review and update import statements and dependencies to align with library updates.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement logging or error handling to catch similar issues early in development.

#### Updated Specifications

1. **Functional Specifications:**
   - Maintain consistent use of library modules and functions.
   - Ensure the program compiles and runs without import-related errors.

2. **Non-Functional Specifications:**
   - Improve code clarity and maintainability by using the correct library paths and dependencies.

By addressing the unresolved import error with `ggez::mint::Point2`, the project is expected to compile successfully, allowing further development and optimization of the DVD Logo Bouncing Animation.
