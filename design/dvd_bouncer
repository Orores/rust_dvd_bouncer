#### Title
DVD Logo Bouncing Animation with Adjustable Velocity

#### Objective
Enhance the DVD logo bouncing animation by adding a user interface element that allows the user to input and apply a custom velocity for the logo.

#### Error Prevention
Ensure new implementations do not reintroduce previously known errors, particularly regarding import issues and module management.

#### New Features
1. **Velocity Input Field:**
   - Add a text input field for the user to specify the desired velocity of the DVD logo.

2. **Apply Button:**
   - Include a button that, when clicked, applies the new velocity to the DVD logo.

3. **Default Velocity:**
   - Set the default velocity of the DVD logo to 10 upon initialization.

#### Solution Approach

1. **UI Integration:**
   - Utilize a UI library that complements `ggez` to create the input field and button.
   - Ensure the UI seamlessly integrates with the existing game loop.

2. **Code Modifications:**
   - Update `main.rs` to initialize and handle UI components.
   - Modify `game.rs` to include logic for adjusting the velocity based on user input.

3. **Event Handling:**
   - Capture user input and button click events to update the velocity in real-time.
   - Ensure input validation to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.

4. **Maintain Code Integrity:**
   - Avoid reintroducing known errors by reviewing changes for import and module usage consistency.
   - Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility with existing code.

5. **User Feedback:**
   - Provide feedback or error messages if the input is invalid, ensuring a robust user experience.

#### Design Considerations

1. **User Experience:**
   - Make the input field and button intuitive and easily accessible within the game window.

2. **Performance:**
   - Ensure that the UI updates and velocity changes do not adversely affect the game's performance or responsiveness.

3. **Code Maintainability:**
   - Keep the UI logic modular and separate from core game logic to facilitate future updates and maintenance.

By implementing these features and adhering to the outlined approach, the game will offer enhanced interactivity, allowing users to adjust the logo's velocity dynamically while maintaining stability and performance.
