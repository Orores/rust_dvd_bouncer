The logic you described does not require any changes to the `Cargo.toml` file. The `Cargo.toml` file is used for specifying the package's metadata and dependencies, and the tasks you've described pertain to code logic within the source files. Therefore, no modifications to `Cargo.toml` are necessary for implementing the requested features. If you have any other request or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
